# Lung Cancer Detection from MRI Images using CNN

This repository contains my research work on **detecting lung cancer using MRI images** with deep learning, focusing on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). 

MRI-based lung imaging is relatively underexplored, as most lung cancer research relies on **CT images**. This project investigates whether CNN models can achieve strong diagnostic performance on MRI data, which is radiation-free and clinically valuable.

## 🧠 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a model capable of detecting lung cancer from MRI images.  
Key challenges:
- MRI is not the standard modality for lung cancer → fewer datasets
- MRI has lower contrast and motion artifacts
- Risk of overfitting due to limited samples

Despite these challenges, the improved CNN model achieved **strong classification results**:

| Metric | Score |
|--------|--------|
| Accuracy | 98% |
| Precision | 98% |
| Recall | 98% |
| F1-score | 98% |
