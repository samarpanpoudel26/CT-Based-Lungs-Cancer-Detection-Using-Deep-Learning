# Lung Cancer Detection from CT Images using CNN

This repository contains my research work on **detecting lung cancer using CT images** with deep learning, focusing on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

## 🧠 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a model capable of detecting lung cancer from CT images.  
Key challenges:
- CT has lower contrast and motion artifacts
- Risk of overfitting due to limited samples

Despite these challenges, the improved CNN model achieved **strong classification results**:

| Metric | Score |
|--------|--------|
| Accuracy | 98% |
| Precision | 98% |
| Recall | 98% |
| F1-score | 98% |
